Probabilistic Modelling of Specialty Coffee

Coffee, an essential drug for human civilization. Today we in the 3rd Wave Coffee movement, it has become incredibly easy to get specialty coffee from a Cafe. Specialty coffee prides itself on high quality and traceability. Within each bag sold, the roaster is able to pinpoint which region, elevation and sometimes even farm that the coffee was obtained from. 



However, for beginners getting into coffee, the world of specialty coffee can be extremely daunting. Most roasters try to give 2-3 common flavours like plums, almonds etc. to describe the tasting notes on a bag of coffee. In this project I try to deconstruct these flavour notes that are presented by the roaster to help consumers better understand what they are buying.
